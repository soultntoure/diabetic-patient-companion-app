# Diabetic Patient Companion App

## 1. Project Purpose

This application is designed to empower individuals managing diabetes by providing a comprehensive, personalized, and proactive platform for health management. Our core value proposition is to transform diabetes care from reactive tracking to proactive, informed lifestyle management.

We aim to address critical market gaps by:

*   **Enhancing Sustained User Engagement:** Combating the typical short retention cycles of health apps (median 4-6.5 days) through habit formation, personalized progress celebrations, gamification, and predictive insights.
*   **Delivering Hyper-Personalized Nutritional Guidance:** Offering AI-driven meal planning that precisely correlates food choices with individual glycemic responses, going beyond generic advice to provide truly tailored nutritional optimization.
*   **Bridging Lifestyle Logging and Actionable Health Outcomes:** Moving beyond simple data logging to provide intelligent interpretation, predictive alerts, 'what-if' scenario analysis, and adaptive AI coaching that guides users towards tangible health improvements.

## 2. Technology Stack Justification

Our technology choices are strategically selected to directly address the identified market gaps and deliver a superior user experience and health outcome.

*   **Frontend: React Native**
    *   **Justification:** Enables rapid cross-platform development for both iOS and Android from a single codebase. This allows us to quickly iterate on features and deliver a consistent, high-quality user experience across devices, crucial for **sustained user engagement**. Its component-based architecture facilitates the implementation of engaging UI elements for gamification and personalized feedback loops, directly contributing to habit formation and user retention. Faster development cycles allow us to respond more effectively to user feedback and introduce new engagement features, directly combating the short retention periods seen in competitors.

*   **Backend: Python with FastAPI Framework**
    *   **Justification:** Python's extensive ecosystem of AI/ML libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn) makes it the ideal language for powering our advanced personalization features. FastAPI provides high performance via asynchronous processing, enabling real-time analysis of user data and delivery of instant, personalized feedback. This is vital for **hyper-personalized nutritional guidance** and generating **actionable health outcomes** promptly. Its speed and ease of development also allow for rapid deployment of new predictive models and coaching features, supporting **sustained user engagement** by ensuring a responsive and intelligent experience. The framework's efficiency ensures that complex calculations for glycemic impact prediction or anomaly detection are handled swiftly, providing immediate value to the user.

*   **Database: PostgreSQL**
    *   **Justification:** A robust, reliable, and ACID-compliant relational database. PostgreSQL's advanced features, including JSONB support and powerful indexing, are ideal for storing and querying complex user health data, historical logs, and intricate nutritional information. This is fundamental for the data-intensive AI models required for **hyper-personalized nutritional guidance** and for deriving **actionable health outcomes** through sophisticated data analysis and trend identification. Its ability to handle complex queries efficiently is key to providing users with timely insights and personalized recommendations.

*   **AI/ML Libraries: TensorFlow/PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas/NumPy**
    *   **Justification:** These libraries are the cornerstone of our intelligence layer, directly tackling the identified market gaps:
        *   **Hyper-Personalized Nutritional Guidance:** Libraries like TensorFlow/PyTorch will be used to build deep learning models that predict individual glycemic responses to specific foods and meal combinations. Pandas and NumPy will handle data manipulation and feature engineering, essential for creating the rich datasets these models require.
        *   **Actionable Health Outcomes:** Scikit-learn will be employed for predictive modeling (e.g., risk stratification, anomaly detection in health metrics), while TensorFlow/PyTorch can power more complex AI coaching and 'what-if' scenario engines. This allows us to transform raw logged data into proactive advice and alerts.
        *   **Sustained User Engagement:** AI can personalize content, identify user behavior patterns to proactively offer support, and power gamified elements based on individual progress, fostering deeper connection and retention. Predictive insights and adaptive coaching derived from AI will make the app indispensable for daily management.

*   **DevOps/Containerization: Docker & Kubernetes**
    *   **Justification:** Docker ensures consistent environments across development, staging, and production, simplifying deployment and management. Kubernetes provides automatic scaling, self-healing, and orchestration capabilities, ensuring the application remains highly available and can handle increasing user loads efficiently. This robust infrastructure is essential for maintaining **sustained user engagement** by guaranteeing a reliable and performant service, and for deploying frequent updates to our AI models and features without significant downtime. It allows us to scale our AI capabilities seamlessly as our user base grows.

*   **`src/` (Frontend):** Contains all React Native application code. Organized into `components` for UI elements, `screens` for distinct views, `navigation` for routing, `services` for backend communication, and `utils` for helper functions. This modularity ensures a clean separation of concerns within the client-side application.
*   **`api/` (Backend):** Houses the FastAPI backend. `api/api_v1/endpoints` defines API routes, `schemas` handles data validation using Pydantic, `crud` manages database interactions abstracting SQL queries, `models` defines database entities (e.g., using SQLAlchemy), and `services` contains business logic and integrations, particularly for AI/ML functionalities.
*   **Root Directory:** Contains project configuration files, Docker configurations (`docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`), dependency lists (`requirements.txt`), and environment variables (`.env`). This central location manages the project's build, run, and deployment infrastructure.

    *   Install backend dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   Configure environment variables: Create a `.env` file in the `api/` directory with your PostgreSQL connection string and other necessary configurations (e.g., `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`).
    *   Run database migrations (if using an ORM like SQLAlchemy with Alembic):
        ```bash
        alembic upgrade head
        ```
    *   Start the FastAPI development server:
        ```bash
        uvicorn api.main:app --reload
        ```

4.  **Frontend Setup:**
    *   Navigate to the project root directory.
    *   Install frontend dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        # or
        yarn install
        ```
    *   Start the React Native development server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        # or
        yarn start
        ```
    *   Run the application on an emulator or physical device:
        ```bash
        npm run android
        # or
        npm run ios
        ```

5.  **Dockerized Setup (Recommended):**
    *   Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running.
    *   From the project root, run:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up --build
        ```
    This will build and start the backend, database, and potentially other services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
